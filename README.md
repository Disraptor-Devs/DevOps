# Disraptor DevOps Repository

Welcome to the Dirsaptor DevOps Repository! This repository serves as a central hub for all things DevOps related.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this repository is to provide a comprehensive platform for managing and documenting our DevOps processes and tools. Currently, it serves as a foundation for the following but will be further extended as time goes on:

- **Dynamic Cloud Service Orchestration**: We leverage dynamic cloud service orchestration to efficiently manage and scale our cloud resources. This process makes use of reusable Terraform modules and an ansible role to orchestrate provisioning.

### Contributing

- We encourage collaboration and contributions! If you have ideas, improvements, or new DevOps projects related to internal processes, feel free to open issues and pull requests.

## Contact

- For questions or assistance, please contact any of the DevOps Leads
